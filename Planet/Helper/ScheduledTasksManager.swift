/**
 Global tasks manager for system-wide scheduled operations.
 Use this class to handle tasks that should run independently of any SwiftUI view lifecycle, such as checking for content updates, background data synchronization, or other system-level operations.
 For tasks that are directly tied to a viewâ€™s lifecycle, manage them within the view or its dedicated view model.
