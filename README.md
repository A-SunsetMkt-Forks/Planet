# Planet

Planet is a free and open-source software for publishing and following web content, and it does not require a centralized server or service. It uses IPFS to achieve peer-to-peer content distribution. Furthermore, you can link your content to an Ethereum Name (.eth) so that others can follow you via Planet by the .eth name. Since both IPFS and ENS are decentralized, you can build your websites or follow others, all in a decentralized manner.

## Build the macOS App

To use your own build config for setting `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, please create a `local.xcconfig` file alongside the `Planet.xcconfig` file.

The following configuration variables can be overridden:

- DEVELOPMENT_TEAM
- CODE_SIGN_STYLE
- ORGANIZATION_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX
